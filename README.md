# Twitter Sentiment Analysis #
### A machine learning model predicting the sentiment of Tweets ###

You can check the web application deployed on Heroku here: [Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://twitter-sentim-analysis.herokuapp.com/)

### Project Summary: ###
1. The problem

Social media platforms are essential for businesses to reinforce their brand and connect with their followers and build their community.
Social media platforms like Twitter provide analytics on the performance of your tweets and how to improve their engagement.
However you donâ€™t have a clear picture on tweets mentioning your brand. 

2. Our solution

The Twitter sentiment analysis app is designed to provide insights on tweets mentioning your brand with # or @.

### How to read the code: ###

The repository contains the following folders:
- Model folder: Jupyter notebook training the Recurrent Neural Network model which is saved under the name "tweeter_ml_trained_1.6.h5".
Please note the dataset I used is not in the repository due to the size of the file. However you can access it here on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140)
- Presentation folder contains the Powerpoint presentation.
- img contains images
   
The other files:
- app.py is the app. It is run by Streamlit. So to run it you have to enter: streamlit run app.py
- config.py for authentication
- Procfile, nltk.txt, and setup.sh for Heroku deployment configurations
- requirements.txt with all the requirements needed to run the app.

### How to run Streamlit: ###
Enter in the console: streamlit run app.py
